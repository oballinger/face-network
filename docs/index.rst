Face-Network Documentation
========================================

Given a large volume of images of people, this tool generates a social network graph based on co-appearance in images. This is accomplished in three steps:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   extract
   cluster
   network

The three steps above correspond to the black arrows on the left of the diagram below: 

.. figure::  images/image3.png

Below is an interactive example of an image co-appearance network generated by this tool:
